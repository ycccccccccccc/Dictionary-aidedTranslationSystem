# Dictionary-aided Automatic Translation of Technical File

❌ Drawbacks of modern machine translation
* Inability to specify specific terminologies and their translations
* Difficulty in accurately understanding and translating complex terminologies

💡 Our idea
* Integrating a dictionary into the preprocessing phase of machine translation
* Allowing users to specify translations for specific terminologies

#### In the fall of 2022, I and my team have completed a translation system that enhances the accuracy of translations. Here are some key features:

* Making machine-assisted translation more practical
* No need for retraining when encountering new vocabulary
* Possibly higher generalizability to different domains of documents

## 🚀 Our Approach
#### We start by allowing users to replace specific terms in the source sentences with predefined special tokens. Then, we train a model to understand that these special tokens represent specific terms and translate them into the correct syntax.
